# Portrait Portal

[My Notes](notes.md)

Portrait Portal is a web-based commission management platform that connects clients with custom portrait services. The application features a public portfolio gallery, secure user authentication, commission request forms with file upload capabilities, real-time progress tracking, and client dashboard functionality. Built as a single-page application using React, it integrates backend services for data management and WebSocket connections for live updates.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Multiple pages with hyperlinks to navigate between sections, including: 
    - Public page: Portfolio gallery, about page
    - Login page: Authentication
    - Protected pages: Commission request form, client dashboard
- **CSS** - Application styling that is visually appealing across different devices. Implements artistic yet minimalistic design that utilizes principles of adequate whitespace, pleasing color choice, and visual simplicity while still maintaining individuality. Gallery-style grid layout for portfolio display.
- **React** - Provides portfolio browsing, login, commission submission, progress tracking, messaging, and backend endpoint calls. Single page application with component views that is reactive to user actions.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for managing commissions, file uploads, and progress updates.
- **DB/Login** - Store client authentication, commission details, and project history in database. Secure login required for commission management.
- **WebSocket** - Real-time updates when commission status changes and new messages are received.
