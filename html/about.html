      <!-- The Digital Process -->
      <section>
        <h2>How Digital Creation Works</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p><strong>1. Submit Your Commission</strong></p>
          <p>Upload your high-resolution photos and share your vision. Tell me about the story behind the image, preferred digital style, and any special requests.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <p><strong>2. Digital Consultation & Planning</strong></p>
          <p>I'll review your photos and vision, then provide digital mockups and style recommendations. We'll finalize composition, color palette, and artistic approach before I begin.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <p><strong>3. Digital Creation Process</strong></p>
          <p>Your portrait comes to life through digital stages: initial sketch, base colors, detailed rendering, and final touches. You'll receive work-in-progress screenshots throughout the process.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <p><strong>4. Review & Digital Refinement</strong></p>
          <p>Before completion, you'll receive a preview file for review. Minor adjustments can be made quickly in the digital medium to ensure perfect satisfaction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <p><strong>5. Digital Delivery</strong></p>
          <p>Your finished digital portrait is delivered as high-resolution files (PNG, JPEG) via secure download. Print-ready files included for home printing or professional printing services.</p>
